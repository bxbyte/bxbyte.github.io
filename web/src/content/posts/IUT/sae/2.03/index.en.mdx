## Context

Academic project focusing on system administration and network service deployment in a virtualized environment.
The project addresses practical aspects of server configuration and management.

## Objective

Implementation of a complete network service infrastructure emphasizing:
- Virtual machine setup and management
- Core service installation and configuration
- Remote access configuration
- Database system implementation

## Implementation

### 1. Virtual environment setup

- QEMU-based Debian virtual machine deployment
- CLI-focused installation without desktop environment
- Port forwarding configuration for remote access
- Backup and recovery procedures implementation

### 2. Core services configuration

- SSH service deployment for remote management
- Apache web server installation and verification
- PostgreSQL database setup and user management
- Remote database access configuration

### 3. Service integration

- Network service intercommunication setup
- Security configuration for remote access
- System monitoring implementation
- Performance validation

## Results

Key deliverables:
- Fully functional Debian virtual environment
- Configured network services (SSH, Apache, PostgreSQL)
- Remote access capability for all services
- Comprehensive technical documentation

This infrastructure provides a foundation for web application hosting with database backend support, 
accessible both locally and remotely through configured port forwarding.
