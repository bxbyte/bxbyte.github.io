## Context

Project conducted during the first semester of BUT Computer Science in collaboration with <Author id="thuillim"/>. 

## Objective

Implementation and optimization of automatic text classification algorithms to categorize news articles into 5 categories: politics, culture, environment/technology, economics, and sports.

## Implementation

### Weight based classification

First approach based on weighted scoring per category for each word:
- Word normalization (case, plurals, vowels)
- Binary search optimization
- Common word filtering
- ~65% accuracy 

### <a href={frontmatter.links.knn}>K-nearest neighbors</a>

Second approach using vector representations:
- Articles represented as weight vectors
- Distance calculations between vectors
- Category determined by k closest neighbors vote
- ~75% accuracy with k=5
- Optimized complexity to O(n log n)

## Results

Performance analysis detailed in <a href={reportUrl}>the attached report</a> showed KNN outperforming the weight-based approach while maintaining reasonable computational complexity through optimizations.
