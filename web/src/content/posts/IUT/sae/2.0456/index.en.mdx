## Context

As part of a group project in BUT Computer Science,
we were asked to create a web application promoting France's cultural heritage,
based on open data.

Our team chose to create an application offering tourist activities
around French bridges, based on a

<a href={frontmatter.links.db}>dataset from the French government</a>.

## Design

During the project's design phase, I contributed to writing
the interim report on the following aspects:

- The design of graphical interfaces.

- Technical choices, meaning the languages and software used to
  design and run the application, which included among others:

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.node}>Node.js</a>: a JavaScript code executor used to run the JavaScript code
          of the application server, preferred for its ease of use.

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.typescript}>TypeScript</a>: a JavaScript derivative language adding typing concepts
          to the JavaScript language.

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.astro}>Astro.js</a>: a backend JavaScript framework used to structure the code and
          run the application, distinguished from other JavaScript frameworks by its
          concepts that are "closer" to web natives.

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.drizzle}>Drizzle</a>: a JavaScript ORM allowing easy design and interaction
          with our database, preferred over its more complex competitor Prisma.

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.postgresql}>PostgreSQL</a>: a robust database management system.

          - <a href={frontmatter.links.vue}>Vue.js</a>: a frontend JavaScript framework for managing user interface
          interactions.

## Development

I participated in the website development for both backend
and primarily frontend implementation, being responsible for features such as the site exploration system,
the booking system, and the offer addition system, as well as account creation and login functionality.
